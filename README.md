# Othello
A.I based Othello game.

You can have the A.I players play with several different types of "mindsets" or types of moves.

Types: Greedy, Ndepth, and Ndepth with alpha beta pruning.



Currently default is Ndapth with allpha beta pruning. There is comments inside on how to switch the gamestyles if you would like to see all three.
